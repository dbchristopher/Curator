## Key Features (MVP)

### Must Have

- [ ] Photo library access (PhotoKit integration)
- [ ] Swipe left (trash) / right (favorite) interaction
- [ ] Batch processing with undo functionality
- [ ] Basic photo viewing with zoom/pan
- [ ] Simple organization: Favorites, Keep, Trash categories

### Should Have

- [ ] Basic search and filtering
- [ ] Export favorites to new album
- [ ] Progress tracking and statistics

### Could Have

- [ ] AI-powered auto-categorization
- [ ] Advanced tagging system

## User Journeys

### Primary Journey: Quick Photo Cleanup

1. User opens app and grants photo access
2. App loads recent photos for review
3. User swipes through photos: left (trash), right (favorite), up (keep)
4. App shows progress and provides encouraging feedback
5. User reviews decisions and confirms or makes adjustments
6. App processes changes (moves to trash, creates favorites album)

### Secondary Journey: Finding Organized Photos

1. User wants to find specific photos
2. Opens organized albums (Favorites, Recent Keeps)
3. Uses basic search/filter if needed
4. Selects and shares or exports photos

## Success Metrics

### Engagement

- Time to organize 100 photos < 5 minutes (target)
- User retention: 70% return within 7 days
- Session frequency: 2-3 times per week

### Effectiveness

- Photos processed per session: 50+ average
- User satisfaction with organization results: 8/10+
- Reduced photo library size: 20%+ average

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

- Smooth 60fps scrolling with photo grids
- Image loading: <200ms for thumbnails
- Swipe response time: <50ms
- Support for libraries with 10,000+ photos

### Compatibility

- iOS 15.0+ (supports 95%+ of active devices)

### Privacy & Security

- All processing happens on-device
- No photo data leaves user's device without explicit consent
- Comply with App Store privacy requirements

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- Limited by PhotoKit API capabilities
- App Store review guidelines for photo access
- Device storage and processing limitations

### Business Constraints

- Solo developer initially (simple architecture)
- Free app (no monetization complexity initially)
- 6-month development timeline

### Assumptions

- Users comfortable with swipe interfaces (Tinder, dating apps)
- Photo organization is a real pain point
- Simple binary decisions reduce choice paralysis

## Out of Scope (V1)

- Video organization
- Advanced photo editing
- Cloud storage integration
- Multi-user/family sharing
- Complex tagging systems
- AI-powered facial recognition
